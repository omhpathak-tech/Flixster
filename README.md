### Notes

I faced a couple of challenges when creating this. I have a pretty low-end laptop so running the emulator is very time-consuming and my laptop crashed twice. Anothing challenge I faced was I had some dependencies that were not properly exceuting the program. So I spent a good amount of time to fix that. I will be doing the BONUS on my own time so I learn more about the studio and UI/UX.

### Notes
The only challenge I faced while building this app was the speed of the emulator. It took a lot of RAM usage, and took a lot of my time as I could not code fast.
